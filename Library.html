	<p>The Katz Library for the Upper Division is a central hub of student activity at Horace Mann School. Between making reading recommendations for pleasure reading, helping with databases, or assisting in finding books for specific projects, the librarians and staff are always available to students and faculty. Because we believe that research skills should not be learned in a vacuum, but rather should be tied to curricula, librarians work closely with faculty and students to provide detailed instruction around specific assignments. To this end, the library collects heavily in the areas that will support the curriculum and we consistently order books upon request. The Libraryâ€™s collection houses nearly 54,000 books and DVDs, as well as many print and digital magazines. The Library has access to nearly half a million ebooks and audiobooks for both leisure reading and school projects. In addition, the Katz Library subscribes to roughly fifty research databases that are available 24/7 through remote access with a student or faculty ID. The library provides seating for 180 students, with soft-seating areas for comfortable leisure reading and studying. Over forty laptops are available for student use in the library, as well as twenty desktops. Seven group study rooms, located on both floors of the library, allow students to work collaboratively. One of these rooms also serves as an electronic classroom where research classes meet to work with librarians and their teacher.</p>
