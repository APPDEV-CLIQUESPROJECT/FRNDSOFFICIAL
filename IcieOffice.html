	<center><h1>RESOURCES: ICIE Office</h1></center>
	<center><img src="Screenshot 2022-05-25 at 3.02.00 PM.png" alt="ICIE"></center>
	<p>The Office for Identity, Culture, and Institutional Equity works to ensure that the Horace Mann community is one in which everyone feels a sense of belonging. ICIE does this in a variety of ways, including providing professional development, group discussion facilitation, resources, and support for curriculum development to faculty/staff and students. The office works closely with the parent alliance groups that are based on racial/ethnic identity and sexual orientation, oversees student affinity spaces, and helps to connect the HM community to the many diversity and equity-related resources available in and out of the community. ICIE is also responsible for HM SEED, a professional development program for faculty/staff and parents, that encourages and supports the use of inclusive pedagogy in the classroom. ICIE serves as a resource, advocate, and strategic planner for every member of the HM community.</p>
